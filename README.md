# Deep Work Timer (DWT)

A simple, customizable deep-work timer app inspired by the Pomodoro technique — built with Python and Tkinter.

## 🌟 Project Overview
This is my first project, and I'm excited to share it! The Deep Work Timer app helps you structure focused work sessions with dedicated break times. You can:
- Set the number of sessions you want to complete.
- Customize your work and break durations.
- Stay focused and track your progress visually.

I’ve built two versions so far:

### ✅ **Version 1:**
- Enter the number of sessions you want to complete.
- Fixed work time (25 minutes) and break time (5 minutes).
- Basic GUI for starting, pausing, and resetting.

### ✅ **Version 2:**
- Full customization: choose your work duration, break duration, and number of sessions.
- Updated and cleaner GUI.
- Motivational text display and session tracking.
- Bigger, more aesthetic buttons and labels.

## 🧩 Project Idea
The main goal of this app is to be more productive by breaking work into manageable sessions, and I also thought — why not share this with the community! Everyone works differently, so I wanted to make it flexible — whether you want to do short sprints or long marathons with breaks.
